  Keep a Diary on SFGD-64PCB 

   - @ 20/06/17--21 Noise is huge, 

      - a AC/DC adapter for providing V to EASIROC is too bad, -> put it into a crate,
      - connect metallic mesh wires to a crate and voltage souce.
      - a pulse gene. is put a bit far place w/ a different v-souce. 
        => Config: EASIORC-Splitter-64PCB w/ Logi64OR, thre840 => No noise triggers :)
      - an incubator is turned on --> give huge noise --> grounded with the same mesh wires.
        => Config: EASIORC-Splitter-64PCB w/ Logi64OR, thre840 => No noise triggers :)

      !! due to gain of MPPC, peaks gets close and uncrear w/ low voltage. 
      !! due to increase of noise rate, acq. rate incerease -> pedestal peak gets large (random timing).
